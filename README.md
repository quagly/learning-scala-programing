# learning-scala-programing
just storing scripts I type from the [programming scala](https://www.artima.com/shop/programming_in_scala) book

uses bigtruedata/scala container
may want to pull the latest container from time to time
`docker pull bigtruedata/scala:latest`

consider swithing to alpine based container which is much smaller

`docker pull bigtruedata/scala:2.12.4-alpine`

tried it on a trivial script and made no different to wall clock
try again on a larger script

sample code for the book can be found [here](https://booksites.artima.com/programming_in_scala_3ed/examples/index.html)
